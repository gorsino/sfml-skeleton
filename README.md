# SFML Skeleton Project

This repository was initialized from the template [SFML/cmake-sfml-project](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project#). **Please read this README file first** to understand the structure and purpose of the project.

## Project Description

This project provides a foundation for developing games or applications using the [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php). The structure has been adapted to include a `Game` class, which is instantiated and executed through `main.cpp`. This modular approach offers a solid and extendable base for your SFML projects.

### Structure of the `Game` Class

The `Game` class handles the main program loop, enabling a clear organization of the various stages of game or application development:
- Initialization
- Event management
- Game state updates
- Graphics rendering

This structure also makes code maintenance and expansion easier.

## Requirements

Make sure to have SFML and CMake installed to compile and run the project.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the build commands using CMake.
3. Launch the generated executable to start the application.
